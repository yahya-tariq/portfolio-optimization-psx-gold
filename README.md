# Portfolio Optimization: PSX Stocks & Gold

This project analyzes portfolio risk-return dynamics using PSX-listed stocks and gold data, applying Modern Portfolio Theory to compare equal-weighted and optimized portfolios. The goal is to demonstrate how strategic asset allocation can improve performance using historical data and quantitative methods.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel** â€“ Portfolio modeling, return & risk calculations, Sharpe Ratio, scenario and drawdown analysis
- **Power BI** â€“ Interactive dashboards for visualizing efficient frontier, risk-return metrics (used in final presentation)
- **Python** â€“ Data preprocessing using `fix_prices.py`
- **PSX & Gold data** â€“ Sourced manually and structured for analysis

## ðŸ“Š Key Outcomes
- Sharpe Ratio improved from **0.27 to 0.57** by optimizing portfolio weights
- Included **drawdown analysis** to evaluate downside risk and **scenario-based analysis** to test portfolio performance under extreme conditions
